Cock rings are worn around the penis, either at the base of the shaft or around the base of the shaft and behind the testicles depending on the amount of constriction you want. They can be worn during both solo and partnered play.<br\/><br\/>If you intend to place the cock ring around your shaft and testicles, your penis should be semi-flaccid and flexible enough to bend. Start by stretching the cock ring and putting one testicle in at a time, then push the shaft down through the ring before bringing it over and around until it is lying flat against your pelvis. Use lube to cut down on friction as you adjust the cock ring into place.<\/p>","button_text":"","button_link":"","background_type":"full_width","text_width":"medium","text_position":"center","text_alignment":"left","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","button_background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","button_text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"how_to_use_page_section_z3DUEp":{"type":"how-to-use-page-section","settings":{"heading":"Sizing","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_To_Sizing.webp","image_right":false,"text_content":"<p>When shopping for your first cock ring, simpler is always better.
