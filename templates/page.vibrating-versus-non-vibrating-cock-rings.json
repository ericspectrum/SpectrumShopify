One result of this is that you can keep an erection longer, or have it feel harder due to the increased pressure. And with more surface area comes more sensitive nerve endings! Using a vibrating cock ring allows you to add an additional sensation into the mix, stimulating both you and also a partner. Using a vibrating one solo is fun because it combines sensations with the basic cock ring functions, and with a partner you can wear it in a fashion that lets their clit, perineum, vaginal or anal opening – really anything that’s touching the vibrating portion – be stimulated hands-free with vibration.
